% INPUT: - SCI_subjects = structure containing all the data related to SCI
%                         subjects.
%        - fs_Kin = sampling frequency for the markers
%        - fs_EMG = sampling frequency for the EMG
%
% OUTPT: - SCI_matrix = matrix containing all the features for all the gait
%                       cycles extracted from the SCI subjects.
%        - labels_SCI = the vector containing the labels of all the samples
%                       extracted from the SCI subjects. These labels are
%                       useful in order to keep trace of which sample comes
%                       from a SCI subject and from the FLOAT or NO_FLOAT
%                       condition.
