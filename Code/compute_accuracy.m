function [accuracy] = compute_accuracy(algorithm_struct,gt_struct,year)
% This function computes the accuracy of our detection algorithm for S_4
% subject of 2018 (to have an estimation).
%
% INPUTS: - algorithm_struct = is the struct with all the events computed 
%                              with the event detection algorithm.                          
%         - gt_struct = is the struct with all the events found by visual
%                       detection
% OUTPUT: - accuracy = this is our estimation of the accuracy of our
%                      algorithm.
